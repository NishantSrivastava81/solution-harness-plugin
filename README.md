# Solution Harness — Copilot Agent Plugin

A single-install plugin that provides everything you need to build, refactor, and maintain solutions with GitHub Copilot.

## What's Included

| Component | Count | Contents |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Agents** | 5 | planner, builder, evaluator, reviewer, janitor |
| **Skills** | 15 | /init-solution, /onboard, /add-features, /design-feature, /refine-design, /refactor, /fix-issue, /next-feature, /evaluate, /pre-commit, /status, /log-progress, /harness-health, /testing, /architecture-check |
| **Hooks** | 4 | SessionStart (inject status), Stop (enforce progress log), PreToolUse (block dangerous commands), PostToolUse (trajectory logging) |

## Install

### Option A: From Git URL
In VS Code, run `Chat: Install Plugin From Source` from the Command Palette and enter the repo URL.

### Option B: Local
Clone this repo, then add to your VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "chat.pluginLocations": {
    "C:/path/to/solution-harness-plugin": true
  }
}
```

### Option C: Marketplace
If published to a plugin marketplace, search `@agentPlugins` in the Extensions view.

## Usage

### New Project
1. Open an empty folder in VS Code
2. Switch to the **planner** agent
3. Type `/init-solution Build a REST API for task management with user auth`
4. The skill creates all workspace files: `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/`
5. Switch to **builder** agent → `/next-feature` → build → `/evaluate`

### Existing Project
1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Switch to the **planner** agent
3. Type `/onboard` — analyzes your codebase, generates all harness state files
4. Then:
   - `/add-features` to plan new capabilities
   - `/design-feature` to research patterns and create technical design before building
   - `/refactor` to plan improvements
   - `/fix-issue` to diagnose and fix bugs
5. Switch to **builder** → `/next-feature` → build → `/evaluate`

### Daily Workflow
```
/next-feature          → see what to build
/design-feature        → research patterns, create technical design
/refine-design         → provide feedback, iterate on the design
[switch to builder]    → implement it
/pre-commit            → validate before committing
/log-progress          → record what was done
/evaluate              → quality check
/status                → dashboard view
```

### Maintenance
```
[switch to janitor]    → detect drift, dead code, staleness
/harness-health        → audit if harness components are still needed
/architecture-check    → verify module boundaries
```

## What Gets Created in Your Workspace

When you run `/init-solution` or `/onboard`, the skill creates workspace-specific files:

```
your-project/
├── AGENTS.md                           # Table of contents for agents
├── .github/
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md         # Coding standards (always-on)
│   └── instructions/
│       ├── docs-protection.instructions.md
│       └── test-standards.instructions.md
├── docs/
│   ├── IDEA.md                         # Original idea (immutable)
│   ├── PLAN.md                         # Product specification
│   ├── FEATURES.json                   # Feature tracking (session state)
│   ├── PROGRESS.md                     # Append-only session log
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md                 # Module boundaries & decisions
│   └── trajectory.jsonl                # Agent action log (auto-captured)

## Feature ID Conventions

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `E` | Existing features (documented during /onboard) |
| `F` | New features (/init-solution or /add-features) |
| `R` | Refactoring tasks (/refactor) |
| `B` | Bug fixes (/fix-issue) |

## Principles Applied

| Principle | Source | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Separate generation from evaluation | Anthropic | Builder + Evaluator are distinct agents |
| Work incrementally | Anthropic | One feature at a time, tracked in FEATURES.json |
| File-based session state | OpenAI | PROGRESS.md + FEATURES.json = agent memory |
| Build to delete | Schmid | Every component independently removable; /harness-health audits |
| Feedforward + feedback controls | Fowler | Instructions steer before; evaluator + hooks correct after |
| Harness as dataset | Schmid | PostToolUse hook logs trajectories |
| Entropy control | OpenAI | Janitor agent detects drift |

## Requirements

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- Node.js (for hooks)
- Git (recommended)
